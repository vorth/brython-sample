# brython-sample

This is a [Brython](https://www.brython.info) proof-of-concept, vibe-coded using Claude Sonnet.   The prompt I used:
> I'd like to write a simple proof-of-concept web app using Brython, for example something that uses Python to draw a collection of colored circles

It had a third button for animation, but it did not work so I stripped out all the relevant code.

I also added the link to Brython in the app.
